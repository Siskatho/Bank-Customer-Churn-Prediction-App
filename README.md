# Bank Customer Churn Predictor App

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** for predicting customer churn.  
It allows users to input customer details such as profile, financial information, and business engagement, and then predicts whether the customer is likely to **churn** or remain **loyal** using a pre-trained machine learning model.
